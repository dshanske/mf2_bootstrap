mf2_bootstrap
================

Mf2_bootstrap is a minimally styled bootstrap Wordpress theme based on _s 
that is microformats2 compliant. It will contain  several optional widgetized 
areas, social media icons, and other related features.

The design is continually increasing in modularity in order to make it easier
to work with and to allow for easier child-theming.

It defaults to titles visible only for the Standard Post Format.
